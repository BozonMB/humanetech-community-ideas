### Considerations

![Pyramids of Humane Technology](humanetech-pyramids-model.png)

- There are 2 sweet spots that we are pursuing:
  1. **Humane Technology** as the sweet spot of technology innovation
  2. **Human Flourishing** as the sweet spot for human evolution

- The framework is optimistic and solution-oriented
  - Humane technology leads to human flourishing
  - Harms of technology are not mentioned or addressed at the abstract level
  - The 2 sweet spots will make both technologists and non-tech-savvy people feel at home

- We are building _The Pyramids of Humane Technology_ which are:

  1. The pyramid of (Technology) Alignment
  2. The pyramid of (Digital) Society
  3. The pyramid of (Digital) Wellbeing
  4. The pyramid of (Digital) Freedom

- The pyramid of alignment is upside down, it grows towards the top, as alignment grows

- The others are regular shaped, narrowing, as they work towards an elusive goal

- Each pyramid has 3 levels, Maslow-like, where level 3 represents the top

- The anology to 'pyramid building' is used to explain community concepts and principles.

## Breakdown structure

The following paragraphs provide a breakdown of each of the pyramids into their constituent levels.

- Note: The Concepts are indicative of combinations that can be derived in various contexts. They are just examples.
